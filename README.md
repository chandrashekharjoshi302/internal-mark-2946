<h3 >Apple TV is a digital media player and microconsole developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is a small network appliance hardware that plays received media data such as video and audio to a television set or external display. Since its second generation model, it is an HDMI-compliant source device and can only be connected to an enhanced-definition or high-definition widescreen television through HDMI to function.</h3>
<h4 >Apple TV lacks integrated controls and can only be controlled remotely, either through an Apple Remote, Siri Remote or some third party infrared remotes. Since the fourth generation model, Apple TV runs tvOS with multiple pre-installed software applications. Its media services include streaming media services, TV Everywhere-based services, local media sources, and sports journalism and broadcasts. At a March 2019 special event.</h4>
